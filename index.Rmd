### What is Bayes?

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5}
x = seq(-3,4, length = 100)
df = tibble(x) %>% 
  mutate(`Previous\nknowledge` = dnorm(x,0,1)/sum(dnorm(x,0,1)),
         `Data` = dnorm(x, 2, 0.6)/sum(dnorm(x, 2, 0.6)),
         `New\nknowledge` = `Previous\nknowledge`*`Data`/sum(`Previous\nknowledge`*`Data`)) %>% 
  gather(type,
         value, -x)
df_summ = df %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  summarise(dens_max = max(value),
            x_at_max = x[which.max(value)])
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = value, group = type,
             fill = type)) +
  geom_polygon(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_text(data = df_summ,
            aes(x = x_at_max,
                y = dens_max,
                label = type,
                colour = type),
            nudge_y = 0.005) +
  theme_void() + 
  theme(legend.position = 'None')
```

### How does it work?

  1. Divide up your world into things you know (**data**) and things you don't know (**parameters**)

  1. Create a **generative model** that says what the data would look like if you knew what the parameters were

  1. Calculate the **posterior** probability distribution to obtain our new knowledge using Bayes' theorem (and a helpful R package or Bayesian statistician)

### How does this work for palaeoclimate reconstruction?

1. We know the ancient proxies and the modern proxy/climate relationship. These are our **data**. The ancient climate are our unknown **parameters**

1. We can build a generative model for how ancient pollen might form from ancient climate

1. We turn the Bayesian handle to produce a posterior probability distribution of ancient climate given ancient pollen

### Why is this better?

- **Because you get a probability distribution for your unknowns given what you know**

- **Because you can incorporate external information that you know about your system**

- **Because it avoids terrible $p$-values**

### A note on computation

- Most methods to compute the posterior distribution (the *new knowledge*) work via trial and error on the unknown parameters

- This means that rather than a single best value you get a *spreadsheet of values* that match the data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
post = tibble(
  `c(t_1)` = rnorm(5),
  `c(t_2)` = rnorm(5),
  `c(t_3)` = rnorm(5)
) %>% round(3)
post %>% as.data.frame
```
